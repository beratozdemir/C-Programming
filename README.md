The C programming language is one of the most basic machine languages 
and is a software language for engineers working with embedded systems. 
I will spend as much time as I can on this section and work on it. 
For now, I am presenting the works I have done in the course related to the school. 
You can access the relevant section in the Files section. 
Good work.
